# Feather-Redeemed
Handy all in one tool to scan all private IP address spaces.

## Installation
Right now I am compiling this program and uploading it as a release binary. Feel free to compile it yourself though.

---------
Running from pre-compiled release binary
```
wget https://github.com/Dirkenhymer/Feather-Redeemed/releases/download/v0.1.3-beta/valk2
```
Give the binary executable permission and run!


## Work in progress should be in rust.
